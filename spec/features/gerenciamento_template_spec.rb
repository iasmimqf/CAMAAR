# COMENTADO: Most scenarios require routes and features not implemented in current application
# The Template model doesn't have criador attribute and many admin routes are missing
# These tests would need the full CRUD routes and views to be properly implemented

  let!(:admin_user) { create(:usuario, :admin) }

    login_as(admin_user, scope: :usuario)

  # All scenarios commented out because they depend on:
  # - criador attribute in Template model (doesn't exist)
  # - edit_admin_template_path (doesn't exist)
  # - update/destroy admin template routes (don't exist)
  # - Various view elements and behaviors not implemented

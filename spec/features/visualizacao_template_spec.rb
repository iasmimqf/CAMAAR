# COMENTADO: Most scenarios require routes and features not implemented in current application
# The Template model doesn't have criador attribute and many admin routes are missing
# The admin templates view references new_admin_template_path which doesn't exist

  # All scenarios commented out because they depend on:
  # - criador attribute in Template model (doesn't exist)
  # - new_admin_template_path referenced in views (doesn't exist)
  # - Various view elements and behaviors not implemented
  # - Missing routes for show, edit, destroy actions
